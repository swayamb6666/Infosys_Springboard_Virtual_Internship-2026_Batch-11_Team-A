# Infosys_Springboard_Virtual_Internship-2026_Batch-11_Team-A
Capstone project for the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship (2026 Batch – Team A). This project analyzes Indian election data using Power BI, featuring interactive dashboards on election overview, party performance, demographics, trend analysis, close contests, and winning factor evaluation.


## Project Title - ElectViz: Election Data Visualization for Media 

A comprehensive analytical dashboard system for understanding Indian election patterns, voter behavior, and winning factors.


## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship (2026 Batch – Team A)**. It focuses on analyzing Indian election data to uncover deep insights into party performance, voter behavior, candidate demographics, election trends, and key winning factors.

The project delivers **seven interactive Power BI dashboards** that transform complex electoral data into clear, actionable insights through effective data visualization and storytelling.



## Problem Statement

Election data is inherently complex and multi-dimensional, involving numerous factors such as:
- Vote margins and turnout percentages
- Party dominance across constituencies
- Demographic representation
- Regional variations and trends

**Key Challenges Addressed:**
- Why do parties with higher vote margins sometimes win fewer seats?
- How does election competitiveness evolve over time?
- What factors contribute to consistent electoral success?

Traditional tabular analysis fails to provide clear explanations for these phenomena. This project bridges that gap by transforming raw data into **visual, insight-driven dashboards** that explain both *what happened* and *why it happened*.



## Dataset Information

### Source
The dataset is sourced from publicly available Indian election data repositories and official election records from kaggle.

### Dataset Name : Indian State Level Election Assembly Constituency Dataset

### Dataset Structure and Column Explanation

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Year | Year in which the election was conducted |
| State Name | Name of the Indian state or union territory |
| Assembly Constituency Name | Name of the electoral constituency |
| Candidate Name | Name of the contesting candidate |
| Candidate Type | Category of candidate (SC, ST, BL, General) |
| Party Name | Political party associated with the candidate |
| Gender | Gender of the candidate |
| Total Votes | Total number of votes received by the candidate |
| Total Valid Votes | Total valid votes gained in the constituency |
| Vote Share (%) | Percentage of votes received by the candidate |
| Winning Candidate | Indicator showing whether the candidate won |
| Winning Margin (%) | Percentage difference between winner and runner-up |
| Turnout (%) | Voter turnout percentage in the constituency |
| Seats Won | Number of seats won by a party or candidate |

### Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed using **Power Query**
- Validated for accuracy and consistency
- Structured for optimal performance in Power BI



## Tools and Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Power BI Desktop** | Dashboard development and interactive visualization |
| **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** | Calculated measures, KPIs, and advanced analytics |
| **Power Query** | Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling |
| **Microsoft Excel / CSV** | Raw data storage and preprocessing |



## Visualizations Used

The dashboards emphasize visual storytelling over raw tables, utilizing:

- **KPI Cards** — Seats Won, Vote Share, Turnout, Winning Margin
- **Bar and Column Charts** — Party performance comparisons
- **Line and Area Charts** — Trend analysis over time
- **Stacked Bar Charts** — Cumulative insights
- **Scatter and Bubble Charts** — Correlation analysis
- **Pie and Donut Charts** — Proportional representation
- **Shape Map** — Geographical analysis
- **Slicers and Buttons** — Interactive filtering and navigation



## Key Insights

### Competitiveness Trends
- Elections have become more competitive over time with an increase in close contests
- Median winning margin is a better competitiveness indicator than average margin

### Seats vs. Votes Paradox
- Higher vote margins do not always translate into more seats won
- Parties winning many close contests convert votes into seats more efficiently

### Candidate and Demographic Patterns
- Candidate consistency and repeat victories significantly impact long-term success
- Voter turnout and demographic patterns show substantial regional variation

### Vote Efficiency
- Strategic vote distribution across constituencies matters more than raw vote share
- Winning margin efficiency is a critical factor in seat conversion



## Dashboard Structure

The project comprises seven interactive dashboards, each focusing on a specific analytical dimension:

1. **Election Overview Dashboard** — High-level election metrics and KPIs
2. **Party Performance Analysis** — Comparative party analysis across elections
3. **Gender Distribution Analysis** — Gender-based representation and patterns
4. **Candidate Demographic Analysis** — Comprehensive candidate demographics
5. **Electability Analysis** — Factors influencing candidate success
6. **Trend Analysis** — Electoral trends and patterns over time
7. **Election Outcome and Winning Factor Analysis** — Determinants of electoral victory



## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates the following competencies and skills:

### Technical Skills Gained
- Proficiency in Power BI Desktop for dashboard development and data visualization
- Advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating complex calculations and KPIs
- Data modeling techniques including relationship management and schema design
- Power Query for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
- Visual analytics and interactive report design
- Statistical analysis and trend identification
- Geospatial data visualization using maps

### Soft Skills Developed
- Analytical thinking and problem-solving
- Data-driven storytelling and presentation
- Attention to detail in data cleaning and validation
- Project planning and time management
- Collaborative teamwork and communication
- Critical thinking in interpreting complex datasets
- Professional documentation and reporting



## Conclusion

This project successfully transforms complex election data into an analytical and decision-support dashboard system. By combining trend analysis, demographic insights, and outcome evaluation, the dashboards provide a deeper understanding of electoral behavior beyond surface-level statistics.

The work showcases the power of data visualization in making sense of multi-dimensional datasets and supporting evidence-based decision-making.
